    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hello! My name is Kanti Tuladhar. I have completed my Bachelor 
        and I have a strong interest in technology, web development, and learning
        modern digital skills. I enjoy creating simple and clean websites while
        improving my technical knowledge step by step.

    <h3>Project 1: My First Portfolio Website</h3>
    <p>
        This is my first web development project where I designed and built a
        personal portfolio website from scratch using basic HTML and CSS. The
        main goal of this project was to learn how websites are structured and
        how to present personal and professional information in a clear and
        organized way. I started by planning the layout of the website including
        the header, navigation bar, about section, education details, project
        descriptions, and contact information.
    </p>

    <p>
        During this project, I learned how to use semantic HTML tags to structure
        content properly so that it is easy to read and maintain. I also learned
        how to style webpages using CSS to create a clean layout with cards,
        shadows, spacing, and responsive design elements. One of the important
        skills I developed was organizing information visually so that visitors
        can quickly understand who I am and what I do.
    </p>

    <p>
        I faced challenges while working on layout alignment and navigation
        structure, but through practice and research I was able to solve these
        problems and improve my understanding of web design principles. This
        project helped me build confidence in coding and gave me hands-on
        experience with real development work. In the future, I plan to enhance
        this portfolio by adding JavaScript features, interactive elements,
        animations, and more advanced design techniques. This project represents
        the beginning of my journey into web development and serves as a strong
        foundation for more complex projects that I plan to build as my skills
        continue to grow.
